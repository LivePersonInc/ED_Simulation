 * Receives a period time-dependent input parameters  (e.g. a week's parameters, such as arrival rates, service rates etc.) and:
 * 1. Converges to a steady state realization extracts a "steady state" single period operation.
 * 2. Repeteats this procedure to generate the "average steady state" single period operation.
 * 3. Extracts relevant statistics from this "averate steady state realization", for example: queue size, wait time distribution etc.
 * Currently works only with the ED_Simulation_ReturnToServer
